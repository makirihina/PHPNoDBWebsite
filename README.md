## 📄 Creating a New Page

PurifyFlat uses simple PHP files as pages.
Each page follows the same structure and shares common layout components.

Example: Creating a `partners` page.

1. Create a new file named `partners.php` in your project root.
2. Paste the following content:

```php
<?php

define('DIR_ACCESS', true); // Allow access for visitors

// Include the main configuration
include_once __DIR__ . '/inc/config.php';

// Set up basic page variables
$url = rtrim($cfg_mainurl, '/') . '/partners';
$title = $cfg_name . " - Partners";
$desc = "Partners page description";

// Include URL handler and layout components
include_once __DIR__ . '/inc/url.php';
include_once __DIR__ . '/inc/head.php';
include_once __DIR__ . '/inc/navbar.php';

?>
<!-- Content Start -->

<!-- HTML CONTENT GOES HERE -->

<!-- Content End -->

<?php include_once __DIR__ . '/inc/footer.php'; ?>
```

## 🎨 Theme Development

PurifyFlat does not enforce a strict theme system.  
Instead, it provides a **layout-based structure** that allows you to customize or replace core UI components such as the navbar, footer, and page layouts.

Themes are created by **editing or overriding layout files** inside the `/inc/` directory.

---

### 📌 Core Layout Files

The following files control the global layout and can be customized for theming purposes:

- `/inc/head.php` – `<head>` section, meta tags, CSS includes
- `/inc/navbar.php` – Main navigation bar
- `/inc/footer.php` – Footer layout
- `/assets/` – CSS, JS, images, icons

To create a custom theme, simply modify these files or duplicate them into a new theme structure if desired.
